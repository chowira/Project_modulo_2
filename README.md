This README provides a clear view of how the data model has been transformed from its original state to its final, optimized state for use in the project.



## Description üì¢
This project focuses on a digital product, a dashboard, that uses provided data to create a tool for players to search their game statistics. Players can compare, search, and find other players, view their statistics, and consult a list of the top players, with the ability to filter under various modalities.

## Requirements üìã

* Power BI Desktop: Users must have the latest version of Power BI Desktop installed.

* Internet Connection: Required to access dashboards published in Power BI Service.

* Power BI Account: Users must have a Power BI account to access all functionalities.

## Deployment üì¶

* Navigation: The dashboard consists of three pages. The first and second pages are for data exploration and filter usage. The third page, called "Info," contains information about the functionality and content of the dashboard. It includes buttons for navigation between pages.

* Filters and Slicers: The filters in this dashboard are straightforward and single-selection. They affect the type of search the user wants to perform.

## Conclusion üìÑ
The dashboard is designed to provide players with a comprehensive tool to search, compare, and analyze their game statistics. It allows players to view their own performance metrics, compare them with other players, and explore detailed statistics. The dashboard includes filters and slicers for customized searches, and it features a leaderboard to highlight the top players. Additionally, it offers an "Info" page with information about the dashboard's functionality and content, ensuring users can navigate and utilize the tool effectively
